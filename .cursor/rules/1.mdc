egistry Selection:

Map file type to registry:

package.json → npm

requirements.txt → PyPI

pom.xml → Maven Central

Automated Lookup:

For every dependency name found in the prompt or project context, call the registry API (or HTML scrape as fallback) to retrieve the most recent non‑prerelease version.

Exact Pinning:

Replace any loose version specifier (e.g. ^, ~, or latest) with the exact version string returned by the registry (e.g. "lodash": "4.17.21" or numpy==1.25.1).

Audit Comment:

Insert a comment in the manifest noting the lookup date and source registry, for auditability:
