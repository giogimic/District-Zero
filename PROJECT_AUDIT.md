## Potential Issues & Concerns

### 1. FiveM-Specific Issues

#### Resource Loading & Dependencies
**Issue:** Complex resource dependencies may cause loading issues
- **Risk:** Resource startup failures, dependency conflicts
- **Recommendation:** Implement proper resource dependency management and error handling

#### Performance Impact
**Issue:** Multiple systems running simultaneously may impact server performance
- **Risk:** Server lag, client-side performance issues
- **Recommendation:** Implement performance monitoring and resource usage limits

#### Event System Overload
**Issue:** High volume of custom events may overwhelm the event system
- **Risk:** Event queue overflow, delayed processing
- **Recommendation:** Implement event queuing and throttling mechanisms

### 2. Database & Data Management

#### Database Schema
**Issue:** Complex database schema with multiple interconnected tables
- **Risk:** Database performance issues, data integrity problems
- **Recommendation:** Optimize database queries, implement proper indexing

#### Data Persistence
**Issue:** Large amounts of data being stored and retrieved
- **Risk:** Database size growth, slow query performance
- **Recommendation:** Implement data archiving and cleanup strategies

### 3. Security Concerns

#### Client-Side Security
**Issue:** Client-side code can be modified by players
- **Risk:** Cheating, unauthorized access to server functions
- **Recommendation:** Implement server-side validation for all critical operations

#### Anti-Cheat Effectiveness
**Issue:** Anti-cheat system may not catch all cheating methods
- **Risk:** Players bypassing security measures
- **Recommendation:** Implement multiple layers of security and regular updates

### 4. Scalability Issues

#### Player Load
**Issue:** System may not handle large numbers of players efficiently
- **Risk:** Performance degradation with high player counts
- **Recommendation:** Implement load testing and scaling strategies

#### Resource Usage
**Issue:** High memory and CPU usage with multiple systems
- **Risk:** Server resource exhaustion
- **Recommendation:** Implement resource monitoring and optimization

### 5. Integration Complexity

#### System Dependencies
**Issue:** Complex interdependencies between systems
- **Risk:** System failures cascading to other systems
- **Recommendation:** Implement proper error isolation and recovery mechanisms

#### API Complexity
**Issue:** Complex unified API may be difficult to maintain
- **Risk:** API inconsistencies, maintenance overhead
- **Recommendation:** Implement comprehensive API documentation and testing

## FiveM Best Practices Compliance

### ✅ Compliant Areas
1. **Resource Structure:** Proper resource folder structure
2. **Event System:** Using FiveM's event system correctly
3. **Database Integration:** Proper database connection handling
4. **Client-Server Communication:** Appropriate use of TriggerEvent/TriggerClientEvent
5. **Resource Management:** Proper resource start/stop handling

### ⚠️ Areas Needing Attention
1. **Resource Dependencies:** Need explicit dependency declarations
2. **Performance Monitoring:** Should implement FiveM's performance APIs
3. **Error Handling:** Need more robust error handling for FiveM-specific issues
4. **Resource Limits:** Should respect FiveM's resource limits

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Add Resource Dependencies**
   ```lua
   -- In fxmanifest.lua
   dependencies {
       'mysql-async', -- or oxmysql
       'es_extended'  -- if using ESX framework
   }
   ```

2. **Implement Performance Monitoring**
   ```lua
   -- Add performance monitoring
   local startTime = GetGameTimer()
   -- ... operation ...
   local endTime = GetGameTimer()
   print("Operation took " .. (endTime - startTime) .. "ms")
   ```

3. **Add Error Handling**
   ```lua
   -- Wrap critical operations in pcall
   local success, result = pcall(function()
       -- critical operation
   end)
   if not success then
       print("Error: " .. tostring(result))
   end
   ```
